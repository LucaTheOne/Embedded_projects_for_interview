# Welcome!

Welcome to HomeSpan - a robust and extremely easy-to-use Arduino library for creating your own [ESP32-based](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules/esp32) HomeKit devices entirely within the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc).

HomeSpan provides a microcontroller-focused implementation of Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification Release R2 (HAP-R2) designed specifically for the Espressif ESP32 microcontroller running within the Arduino IDE.  HomeSpan pairs directly to HomeKit via your home WiFi network without the need for any external bridges or components.  With HomeSpan you can use the full power of the ESP32's I/O functionality to create custom control software and/or hardware to automatically operate external devices from the Home App on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, or with Siri.

HomeSpan has recently had its first generational update, transitioning from **version 1.9.1** to **version 2.0.0** (currently available as 2.0.0-rc.1).  This transition was the result of a major, non-backwards-compatible update by Espressif of their core IoT Development Framework (from&nbsp;[IDF-4 to IDF-5](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/migration-guides/release-5.x/5.0/index.html)) and a subsequent update of their [Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) (from version 2 to version 3) to use the new IDF-5.

Requirements to run HomeSpan depend on which version you choose:

|HomeSpan Version | Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager | Partition Scheme | Supported Chips|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
|1.9.1 or earlier | v2.0.0 - v2.0.17 | *Default* (1.3MB APP) | ESP32, S2, S3, C3 |
|2.0.0 or later | v3.0.2 or later | *Minimal SPIFFS* (1.9MB APP) | ESP32, S2, S3, C3, *and C6* |

**ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS**:  Apple's HomeKit architecture [requires the use of a Home Hub](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207057) (either a HomePod or Apple TV) for full and proper operation of any HomeKit device, including those based on HomeSpan.  Use of HomeSpan without a Home Hub is NOT supported.

## ❗Latest Update - HomeSpan 2.0.0-rc.1 (9/27/2024)

* **Compability with version 3 of the [Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32)**

  * version 3 of the Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager is based on Espressif's IDF-5, which is **not backwards compatible with version 2** of the Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager that was based on Espressif's IDF-4
  * the primary focus of HomeSpan 2.0.0-rc.1 is to (minimally) refactor HomeSpan 1.9.1 only as needed to allow it to operate under version 3 of the Arduino-ESP32 board manager ---
    * while **preserving backwards compatibility for all HomeSpan sketches written under HomeSpan 1.9.1**
    * in spite of the many [breaking changes](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/migration-guides/release-5.x/5.0/index.html) that Espressif made between IDF-4 and IDF-5,
    * and numerous additional breaking changes introduced between versions 2 and 3 of the Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager
    * **requires Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager 3.0.2 or greater**
      
* **Support for the ESP32-C6**
  
  * version 3 of the Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager added support for Espressif's ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2 chips
    * HomeSpan supports the use of the C6 chip since it contains a WiFi radio, as currently required by HomeSpan
    * HomeSpan does *not* support the use of the H2 chip since it lacks a WiFi radio (contains only a Thread radio)
 
* **Expanded functionality for the HomeSpan Pixel and RFControl libraries**

  * as a result of Espressif deprecating the IDF4-version of the RMT library and replacing it with a completely new library in IDF-5, the HomeSpan **Pixel** and **RFControl** libraries have been completely written and upgraded:
  * you can now instantiate both **Pixel** and **RFControl** objects in the same sketch (previously these classes were incompatible with eachother and could not be used in the same sketch)
  * the **Pixel** class also adds a variety of new functionality supporting even more types of Pixel devices, including
    * an upgraded [PixelTester](examples/Other%20Examples/PixelTester) sketch that steps users through selecting and testing the correct *pixelType* for their device
    * a new [Pixel-RGBWC](examples/Other%20Examples/Pixel-RGBWC) example demonstrating how to implement an RGBWC Pixel light-strip with separate Home App controls for the RGB and WC LED
    * see the [Addressable RGB LEDs](docs/Pixels.md) page for full details

* ❗**SIZE ALERT** ❗
  * version 3 of the Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager has a **much** larger footprint than version 2
  * **the same HomeSpan sketch compiled under 1.9.1 will be approximately 200K larger under HomeSpan 2.0.0-rc.1**
  * HomeSpan sketches will no longer fit into the *Default* partition scheme, which only allocates about 1.3MB to each OTA partition
  * sketches must be compiled under a larger partition scheme, such as *Minimal SPIFFS*, which provides for 1.9MB OTA partitions
  * **this has implications for upgrading sketches via OTA (see Release Notes for details)**
      
See [Releases](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/releases) for details on all changes and bug fixes included in this update.

# External Resources

In addition to HomeSpan resources, developers who are new to HomeKit programming may find useful Chapters 8 and 9 of Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification, Non-Commercial Version, Release R2 (HAP-R2). This document is unfortunately no longer available from Apple (perhaps because it was last updated July, 2019, and is now somewhat out-of-date).  However, you may be able find copies of this document elsewhere on the web.  Note Apple has not replaced the HAP-R2 document with any other versions for non-commercial use, and Apple's open-source [HomeKit ADK](https://github.com/apple/HomeKitADK) only reflects the original HAP-R2 specs (rather than all the latest Services and Characteristics available in HomeKit for commercial devices).

### Matter and Thread

There are no plans to make HomeSpan compatible with Matter since HomeSpan was structured entirely around HAP R2.  In addition, both Apple and Espressif have released Matter SDKs for public use, reducing the need for yet another Matter SDK.

Connecting HomeSpan directly to HomeKit via Thread is not planned (and might not even be possible).  However, Thread may be useful for inter-device communication similar to how HomeSpan uses ESP-NOW to implement remote, battery-operated devices.  This may be added at some point in a future release.

### Feedback or Questions?

Please post bug reports or other problems with HomeSpan to the [Issues Board](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/issues).  Please post all other questions about HomeSpan (use, functionality, specs, examples, etc.) or any ideas or recommendations you may have for new functionality, or any general feedback about HomeSpan or HomeKit, to the [Discussion Board](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/discussions).  For more general questions or feedback not related to a specific HomeSpan issue or function, you can email me directly at [homespan@icloud.com](mailto:homespan@icloud.com).

### About the Author

HomeSpan was developed and continues to be maintained and supported by Gregg Berman.  It was originally conceived to solve the pesky problem of not being able to operate an RF-controlled kitchen vent hood with Siri.  I hope you find it useful as well as fun to use.

This is my second large-scale open-source project --- my first was the design of an open-source sytem for operating model railroads using nothing more than an Arduino Uno and Arduino Motor Shield to generate digital command and control (DCC) signals.  Though I have not been involved with the model railroading hobby for many years, videos showcasing my original system (dubbed DCC++), along with detailed tutorials of how it works, are still available on the [DCC++ YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dcc2840/videos).
